                We are A Trike Called Funk, a creative collaboration of artistic expression, movement and a trike-based sound system. We came together
                toward the end of the Covid-19 pandemic to bring joy and love to communities around Boston through movement and artistic expression.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In the past year, we have partnered with businesses, community groups and local artists around the city to
                host what we call "activations." A typical activation involves our main funkers, A.a.ron Myers and Ed Word Galan,
                community members, good music and of course, our trike. 
                <br/>

              An activation begins when A.a.ron Myers and Ed Word Galan, the dynamic duo behind our organization, arrive on the scene, ready to jam! 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Other DJs and music venues may depend on electricity or a permit, but our battery-powered sound system and 
              portable dance floor help us bring the funk almost anywhere.

              <br/>
              As A.a.ron puts it, “Movement says more than you could say in words, it builds a sense of community, 
              bridges people who might see themselves in different groups or communities.”

              A.a.ron likes to start off the dancing, pulling in onlookers while Ed Word
