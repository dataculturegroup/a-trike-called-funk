                A Trike Called Funk is a one-of-a-kind front-loading cargo tricycle converted into a mobile marketing vehicle and performance platform that's equipped with its own portable dance floor, power source, sound system, and DJ set-up.
              </p>
              <p>
                Co-founders A.a.Ron Myers and Ed Word Galan are dancers and DJs who created A Trike Called Funk in response to local artists losing their spaces to practice and perform during the pandemic.  On the wheels of the Trike, they took their talents outdoors and into the streets, using music & movement to activate public spaces and bring joy to people in & around Boston.
              </p>
              <p>
                This was the formulation of A Trike Called Funk’s activations–community-based interactive arts experiences that have become a local sensation!

              Nonprofit organizations, city government departments and private companies often hire A Trike Called Funk 
              to provide a fun-filled and family-friendly entertainment experience at their events.

              Before each activation, A.a.Ron Myers and Ed Word Galan roll out to set up at their target location, which is 
              typically an outdoor public place with limited infrastructure & amenities.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              But no worries!  A Trike Called Funk has its own portable battery that powers all of our equipment.
              For announcements or remarks, we’ve got a mic that together with our speakers double as a PA system.
              And our portable dance floor can be flexibly configured so we can get down anywhere around town.

              A Trike Called Funk's activations include multiple forms of expression, and often feature workshops, 
              dance lessons and/or DJ sets by local artists.

              MC & Dance Lead A.a.Ron kicks off each activation by introducing A Trike Called Funk and thanking the
              event's sponsor.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              DJ Ed Word then drops the beat and A.a.Ron starts to dance on and around the dance flor,
              interacting with peopel and inviting them to get down.

              Kids are usually the first to get out on the floor.  A.a..Ron often engages them with dance-based games.  And with a little encouragement, he also gets the grown-ups into the groove, too.
              <br /><br />
              Along the way, A.a.Ron sends shouts outs to celebrate people’s creativity.  And at times DJ Ed Word spins out from behind the turntables to co-lead with A.a.Ron easy-to-follow routines that get everyone dancing.

              but A Trike Called Funk's enthusiasm and dance prompts make it fun and easy to get down together.

              But the main aim of A Trike Called Funk's activations remians the same: unleashing creativity, 
              connecting people and building community.

              <br/>
